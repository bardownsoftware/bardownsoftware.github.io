    <p>Some things I've been working on...</p>

    <h2>Mostly Done</h2>

    <p>A straight-forward daily task managing app for iOS.</p>
    <p>For more information please visit <a href="http://mostlydoneapp.com">mostlydoneapp.com</a>.</p>   
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mostly-done/id1131771017?mt=8" style="display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;background:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/images/badges/en-us/badge_appstore-lrg.svg) no-repeat;width:165px;height:40px;"></a>

    <h2>Clock</h2>

    <p>Use this app to turn your phone into a night stand clock. With a simple interface for dimming the screen brightness and changing the font and colour. For fun, the app also includes instructions to build a stand with Lego bricks.</p>

    <p>While not a terribly complicated app, it does demonstrate various design patterns such as Key Value Observing, View Models, Protocols, Delegates, and Singletons.</p>

    <p>You will also find a custom view, categories, and helpful utilities in the Components folder.</p>

    <p>The source can be found <a href="https://github.com/bardownsoftware/bardownsoftware.github.io/tree/master/code">here</a>.</p>
