    <p>Some things I've been working on...</p>

    <h2>Scoresheet</h2>
    
    <p>A simple app for keeping score while you play your favourite game. Open Scoresheet instead of grabbing a pencil and sheet of paper. Create a new scoresheet by entering player names. Then after each round of play enter each the score for each player. Scoresheet will sum the score totals for you.</p>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scoresheet/id1131771017?mt=8" style="display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;background:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/images/badges/en-us/badge_appstore-lrg.svg) no-repeat;width:165px;height:40px;"></a>

    <p>Written entirely in Swift by me. Scoresheet uses CoreData, a View-Interactor-Presenter architecture, and has a funky sketchy look. Enjoy!</p>
    
    <p>If you have any feedback then I'd love to hear from you. Please send an <a href="mailto:scoresheet@bardownsoftware.com">email</a>.</p>

    <h2>Clock</h2>

    <p>Use this app to turn your phone into a night stand clock. With a simple interface for dimming the screen brightness and changing the font and colour. For fun, the app also includes instructions to build a stand with Lego bricks.</p>

    <p>While not a terribly complicated app, it does demonstrate various design patterns such as Key Value Observing, View Models, Protocols, Delegates, and Singletons.</p>

    <p>You will also find a custom view, categories, and helpful utilities in the Components folder.</p>

    <h2>Timer</h2>

    <p>Get fit using this timer app. Set the number of repetitions, the duration of each rep and the amount of rest between each rep. Set up multiple timers, select one for your workout, and tap Start to get sweating.</p>

    <p>Written mostly in Swift. Demonstrates using a bridging header to utilize Objective-C components. Uses Cocoapods to incorporate MagicalRecord component - simplifying the effort of dealing with CoreData. Also illustrates how to derive from UIControl, play sound effects using AudioServices, customize a UITableViewCell, and set up various convenience methods via categories.</p>
