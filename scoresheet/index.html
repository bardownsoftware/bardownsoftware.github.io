    <p>A simple app for keeping score while you play your favourite game. Open Scoresheet instead of grabbing a pencil and sheet of paper. Create a new scoresheet by entering player names. After a round of play enter the score for each player. Scoresheet will sum the score totals for you.</p>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scoresheet/id1131771017?mt=8" style="display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;background:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/images/badges/en-us/badge_appstore-lrg.svg) no-repeat;width:165px;height:40px;"></a>

    <p>Written entirely in Swift by me. Scoresheet uses CoreData, a View-Interactor-Presenter architecture, and has a funky sketchy look. Enjoy!</p>
