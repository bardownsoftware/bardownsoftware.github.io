    <h2>Scoresheet</h2>

    <p>A simple app for keeping score while you play your favourite game. Open Scoresheet instead of grabbing a pencil and sheet of paper. Create a new scoresheet by entering player names. After a round of play enter the score for each player. Scoresheet will sum the score totals for you.</p>

    <p>Written entirely in Swift by me. Scoresheet uses CoreData, a View-Interactor-Presenter architecture, and has a funky sketchy look. Enjoy!</p>
